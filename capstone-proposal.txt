Project Proposal Template
Name of Student: Jennifer Holcomb

Name of Project: (still working on name) 

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?) 
 - A forecasting tool used by small restaurants to plan food inventory and labor

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
- API calls to determine tourism probability (Airdna - get % rentals booked on specific day)
- API for weather (many free API's, maybe OpenWeather?)
- API for tracking how many out-of-towners are in area (have yet to find an API that tracks this)
- vendor invoice into NoSQL 
    - use OCRLY API to turn scans to text
    - track data, highlight changes with red/yellow/green prompts
    - (still figuring out exactly what this data looks like)
- calendar to extract data by date?

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
- React/Javascript
- CSS/HTML
- NoSQL - Firestore
- (still researching what else)

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
- incorporate the restaurant menu/ highlight items to push / items to pull (based on costing)
- 

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
- not sure yet

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
- this is still evolving... Have general sense of how I'd like app to look when finished, but will have better idea as I start building
